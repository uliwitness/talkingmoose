# "Painted Moose" animation by M. Uli Kusterer. This is the first
# Moose 'new-style' moose animation that is contained in a package
# instead of a resource file. This allows for larger animations.
# This animation was created from a scanned painting made using
# water colors.

# in the user-selected background color. For best results, an image
# that you want tinted should be a greyscale image.

# This tells the Moose that this animation doesn't have an image for
# every available phoneme but instead supports only the reduced five
# or so phonemes of the initial Moose releases. 
REDUCED PHONEMES

# for the different positions of the eyes, which will be used when the
# Moose looks in the mouse arrow's direction.
