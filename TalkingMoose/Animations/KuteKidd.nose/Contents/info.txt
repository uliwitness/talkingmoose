BACKGROUND
base

# The following line tells the Moose to tint the background image
# in the user-selected background color. For best results, an image
# that you want tinted should be a greyscale image.
TINT BACKGROUND

# This tells the Moose that this animation doesn't have an image for
# every available phoneme but instead supports only the reduced five
# or so phonemes of the initial Moose releases.
REDUCED PHONEMES

# The following tells the Moose that this animation also contains icons
# for the different positions of the eyes, which will be used when the
# Moose looks in the mouse arrow's direction.
EYES FOLLOW MOUSE

# Name (without exension) of the image file to overlay over the animation
