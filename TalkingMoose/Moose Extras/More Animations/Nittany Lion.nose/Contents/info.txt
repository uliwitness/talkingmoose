# Name (without extension) of the image file to use as the background. I
# am planning to someday allow providing several backgrounds for one
# animation, but that's still a dream of a distant future...
BACKGROUND
base

# The following line tells the Moose to tint the background image
# in the user-selected background color. For best results, an image
# that you want tinted should be a greyscale image.
TINT BACKGROUND

# Now, you could write "REDUCED PHONEMES" here to tell the Moose that this
# animation doesn't have an image for  every available phoneme but instead
# supports only the reduced five or so phonemes of the initial Moose releases. 
REDUCED PHONEMES

# The following tells the Moose that this animation also contains icons
# for the different positions of the eyes, which will be used when the
# Moose looks in the mouse arrow's direction.
