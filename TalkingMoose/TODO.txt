TO DO!
-> More intuitive window widgets and drag areas. Maybe at top in regular OS X look?
-> Detect printing and speak special phrases then.
-> Adopt LSSharedList for login items setting.
-> Watch certain folders (Trash, Downloads) with a kqueue so we can talk about what user's doing.
-> Splotch needs to implement @response@ etc.
-> Remove question marks etc. from wildcard matches.
-> Add more stuff to Splotch.
-> Make Splotch's @blah@ stuff more generic.
-> Why does band-aid not disappear sometimes?
-> When moose changes, try to detect whether it's in a corner or at an edge, and
   try to resize relative to that (like Adium).
-> Add a button to add a sentence as a phrase to a "User Phrases" phrase file
   as a specific category.
-> Still need a "keep awake sound" option?
-> Pause speech until Moose has fully faded in, so it doesn't speak without showing on slow Macs.
-> Make Moose use less CPU?
-> AppleScript: Allow retrieving the options set for speech in the Moose panel.
-> AppleScript: Allow changing what Moose, voice and what animation are used.
-> Make Moose "scroll in" from screen edge like a popup folder?
-> Make Moose "scroll in" upside-down from the top?
-> Make edges of animations suitable for light *and* dark backgrounds.
-> The moose might consider taking control of iTunes (or other audio) and
	lowering the volume on my blasting music before speaking.  I frequently
	can't really hear him over my tunes.

 Ã Move area needs to be positioned more reliably, it disappears occasionally.

 Ã More padding at top/bottom of speech bubble window.
 Ã Add "exclude applications" section
 Ã Write "fade in"/"fade out" category on NSWindow and use that for the Moose.
